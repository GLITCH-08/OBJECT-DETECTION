Create a web application where users can
upload an image, and the application uses a 
pre-trained machine learning model (such as a
convolutional neural network) to recognize
objects or patterns in the image. Use HTML for
the upload form, CSS for styling, JavaScript for
interactivity, and Python with a library like
TensorFlow or PyTorch for the machine learning
model.
